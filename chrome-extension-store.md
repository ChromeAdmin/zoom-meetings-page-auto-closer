## Privacy Practices
### Single purpose
Auto closes Zoom tab automatically after joining the meeting and restores focus to the tab you were on before Zoom opened.
### Permission justification
This extension is limited to only run on specific zoom.us and zoomgov.com pages that are shown after joining a meeting, because those are the pages that we show to countdown timer on.
